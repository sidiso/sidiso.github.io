title: The SIDISO project
---

The SIDISO (Spectral Imaging for DIffraction limited Space Observation) aims to
develop new and original data processing methods and algorithms for space
observation.

It's a collaboration between [L2S](http://www.l2s.centralesupelec.fr) and
[IAS](https://www.ias.u-psud.fr/). [F. Orieux](https://pro.orieux.fr), within
[L2S], is the PI of research and development on novel data processing and
algorithms.

For now, the primary focus is on the [MIRI](https://www.jwst.fr/2021/02/miri/)
instrument of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

The main objective is to take into account the spatial and spectral blurring, in
the reconstruction of the sky. Proposed methods rely on inverse problems and
Bayesian approaches.

# Funding

This project is co-funded by

- [CNES](http://cnes.fr/) (Centre national d'études spatiales)
- [ANR](http://anr.fr/) (Agence nationale de la recherche)
- [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/).

This work was performed using HPC resources from the “Mésocentre” computing
center of CentraleSupélec and École Normale Supérieur Paris-Saclay, supported by
CNRS and Région Île-de-France
([http://mesocentre.centralesupelec.fr/](http://mesocentre.centralesupelec.fr/)).
