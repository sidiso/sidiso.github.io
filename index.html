<p>The SIDISO (Spectral Imaging for DIffraction limited Space Observation) aims to
develop new and original data processing methods and algorithms for space
observation.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a collaboration between <a href="http://www.l2s.centralesupelec.fr">L2S</a> and
<a href="https://www.ias.u-psud.fr/">IAS</a>. <a href="https://pro.orieux.fr">F. Orieux</a>, within
<a href="http://www.l2s.centralesupelec.fr">L2S</a>, is the PI of research and development on novel data processing and
algorithms.</p>

<p>For now, the primary focus is on the <a href="https://www.jwst.fr/2021/02/miri/">MIRI</a>
instrument of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).</p>

<p>The main objective is to take into account the spatial and spectral blurring, in
the reconstruction of the sky. Proposed methods rely on inverse problems and
Bayesian approaches.</p>
