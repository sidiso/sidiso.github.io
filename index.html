The SIDISO (Spectral Imaging for DIffraction limited Space Observation) aims to
develop new and original data processing methods and algorithms for space
observation.

It's a collaboration between [L2S](http://www.l2s.centralesupelec.fr) and
[IAS](https://www.ias.u-psud.fr/). [F. Orieux](https://pro.orieux.fr), within
[L2S], is the PI of research and development on novel data processing and
algorithms.

For now, the primary focus is on the [MIRI](https://www.jwst.fr/2021/02/miri/)
instrument of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

The main objective is to take into account the spatial and spectral blurring, in
the reconstruction of the sky. Proposed methods rely on inverse problems and
Bayesian approaches.
