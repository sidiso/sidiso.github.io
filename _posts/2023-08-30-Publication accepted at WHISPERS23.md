[The publication](https://hal.science/hal-04280356) of Dan Pineau entitled "Exact Solution for Multispectral and Hyperspectral Fusion via Hessian Inversion" has been accepted to WHISPERS 2023 at Athens, Greece.

> Multispectral and hyperspectral data fusion allows the restora- tion of data with increased spatial and spectral resolutions. A common approach is to solve an ill-posed inverse problem by minimizing a regularized least squares criterion. This mini- mization usually requires an iterative gradient-based method, but this paper demonstrates the existence of an explicit solu- tion. Direct models of the imager and the spectrometer are described, the explicit solution is developed, and an applica- tion on simulated data from the James Webb Space Telescope is presented. A potential time saving of a factor of 1 000 is highlighted by the proposed method.
