# First result from SIDISO project on JWST data !

After hard work, the SIDISO project is proud to produce the first data
processing of the projet from the JWST data. The algorithm is the results of the
research published [here](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2020.2998170), followed by
subsequent development.

The main objective of such work is to improve the spatial resolution of the
image. We will describe in more details later what have been done.

Many work are need to be done yet on the models and algorithms to improve the
results. Stay tuned.
