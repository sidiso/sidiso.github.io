After hard work, the SIDISO project is proud to produce the first data processing of the projet from the JWST data. The image has been produced by the `luigiz` algorithm[^1], written by [Fran√ßois Orieux](https://pro.orieux.fr). The algorithm is the results of the research published [here](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2020.2998170), followed by a lot of subsequent developments.

The main objective of such work is to improve the spatial resolution of the image. We will describe later in more details what has been done.

More works are necessary to improve the results, like models evolution, algorithms adaptation, or tests. Stay tuned...
