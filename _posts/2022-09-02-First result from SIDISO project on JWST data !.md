After hard work, the SIDISO project is proud to produce the first data processing of the projet from the JWST data. The images have been produced by `luigiz`  the Super-Resolution and deconvolution algorithm[^1], written by [Fran√ßois Orieux](https://pro.orieux.fr). The algorithm is the results of the research published [here](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2020.2998170), followed by a lot of subsequent developments.

The main objective of such work is to improve the spatial resolution of the images. We will describe later in more details what has been done. The two images belows are obtained with the F770W, F1000W, F1130W and F2100W filters.

More works are necessary to improve the results, like models evolution, algorithms adaptation, or tests. Raw data will be made available soon. Stay tuned...
